I am currently the Head of Data, AI/ML at Programa, where I focus on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve complex business problems and drive innovation. My academic journey led me to a Ph.D. from RMIT University, where I delved into the complexities of search and ranking algorithms.

Previously, I had the opportunity to enhance the search capabilities at Canva. I also spearheaded projects at Coles and Seek, focusing on integrating AI to optimize search and recommendation systems, which significantly improved operational efficiencies and user satisfaction.

My passion lies in the intersection of academia and industry. I believe that blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications yields the most innovative solutions. I also run the[ Melbourne Search & Recommendation Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-search/) hoping to foster a community that embraces continuous learning and application of AI in search & recommendation.

I am committed to mentoring and guiding the next generation of AI professionals and researchers, ensuring they can bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications.
