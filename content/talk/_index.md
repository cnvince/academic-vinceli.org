Abstract:\
\
In this talk, I will explore how AI can help understand query intent in the context of ecommerce search. We will focus on two specific aspects of this problem: query categorization and query similarity. Specifically, I will describe how to train a query categorization model from engagement data and how to recognize equivalent queries using embeddings trained from search behavior.\
